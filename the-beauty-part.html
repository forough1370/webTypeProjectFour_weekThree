      <p class="title">THE BEAUTY PART</p>

        <div class="main-text">
        In 1993, at the height of the commotion about the “cult of the ugly” in contemporary design, Katherine McCoy sent me a letter at Eye, where I was then editor. She explained that, although she found herself looking for something in art and design related to beauty, she would have to use other words to describe it. “Some paradigms work better than others,” she concluded. “I prefer integrity and authenticity and quality and appropriateness. But these take a little more work than simple-minded beauty.”

        <p>As a design educator, everything that McCoy had to say about our problem with beauty rang true. In art, it had long ago become an impossibly difficult word. Picasso’s Les Demoiselles d’Avignon, in 1907, was a jarring, brutal, deliberately unlovely painting. Marcel Duchamp poured ironic scorn on work that was merely “retinal,” and he sought to put art at the service of the mind. In the decades of Pop, Arte Povera, and conceptual art, no artist or critic of any seriousness would have had the temerity to declare beauty as a goal.</p>

        <p>Yet, even as McCoy expressed the prevailing wisdom, the first small stirrings of a reevaluation were under way—in Las Vegas, of all places. Art critic Dave Hickey’s The Invisible Dragon: Four Essays on Beauty threw down the gauntlet with an immensely winning disregard for conventional pieties that made people take notice. “If images don’t do anything in this culture,” he ventured, “if they haven’t done anything, then why are we sitting here in the twilight of the twentieth century talking about them?…this is why I direct your attention to the language of visual affect—to the rhetoric of how things look—to the iconography of desire—in a word, to beauty!”</p>

        <p>Beauty may have been banished from polite conversation in the academy, but for most people, it hardly needs saying, it never went away. Popular culture is obsessed with it, in the shape of teenage pop singers, supermodels, and movie stars. Glossy magazines and ads relentlessly proclaim an ideal of physical beauty without caring so much as a discarded thong for art’s critical discourse. People respond to faces, flowers, gardens, animals, the sky, and the landscape much as they always did. We hunger for these things; we feel their goodness; we are in some way lifted and recharged by them. And then there is design—evidence, for the editors at Time, that we are more preoccupied than ever by the appearance of the things we consume. “Function is out. Form is in,” trilled a recent cover story. “From radios to cars to toothbrushes, America is bowled over by style.”</p>

        <p>Little by little, the idea of beauty as an issue for reappraisal is gaining ground. Uncontrollable Beauty, a 1998 anthology, gathered essays by Arthur Danto, Thomas McEvilley, and Donald Kuspit, as well as by Hickey. Esthetic rapture is not regressive, argues art critic Peter Schjeldahl. “The self you lose to beauty is not gone. It returns refreshed. It does not make you less intelligent. It gives you something to be intelligent about.” Last year, Susan Yelavich of the National Design Museum reported that at a late 1990s “think tank” organized by none other than Kathy and Mike McCoy, beauty was back on the agenda as a hot topic. In London last July, I might add, my daily paper ran a series of weekly articles reassessing beauty’s place in contemporary culture.</p>

        <p>In graphic design, though, beauty has yet to receive anything like the same kind of attention. If designers don’t have much to tell us about beauty, this perhaps stems more from a pervasive sense that the word is unfashionable than from a considered philosophical rejection. From time to time, design competitions are criticized as “beauty pageants”—as if to say they are vain, frivolous, lacking in depth—but leading designers still submit their work and then turn up to collect their prizes, and no one is very surprised that they do.</p>

        <p>The reality is that graphic design is a profession wholly in thrall to its own visions of formal beauty. Beauty is the single quality designers most value and crave. In many ways, the debate about ugly design was a red herring. What was actually happening, at that point, was that new forms of expression and a new kind of beauty were emerging, and some people didn’t get it. Then, after a while, they did, and this work ceased to be controversial. It was disappointing that there was little attempt, at the time, to talk about what was and wasn’t successful—and why. But, looking back, this may have been because, even to its admirers, the work was so new that they hadn’t entirely come to grips with it. To enter into a discussion of quality would look like a concession to those who saw no merit in the new.</p>

        <p>Most people enter design because they love visual form, respond to it more acutely, perhaps, than to anything else, and want to manipulate it. Anyone motivated solely, or even primarily, by the satisfactions of the eye would have been misguided, in the last three decades, to have chosen art as a career. As Elaine Scarry points out in On Beauty and Being Just (a book-length essay of great beauty, by the way), the belief has been that to look is to reify, to do the object of the gaze harm, even in the act of admiring it. Pleasure-filled perception is morally bad. “Aversive” perception—looking at things that offer no pleasure—is morally good. The sensual,celebratory art of, say, Matisse is a no-brainer. Art should be awkward, difficult, aggressive, demanding.</p>

        <p>Scarry explains brilliantly why this thinking is mistaken, but for designers it was never necessary to worry too much about it. Frankly, your career was unlikely to depend on it. Naturally, some highly educated designers did deplore thoughtless visuality. They were quick to point out, for instance, how our understanding of real objects’ place in history was harmed by colleagues who plundered this imagery for visual effect. They were right, of course, and the determination to think more seriously about design was positive. But somewhere in the struggle to win the argument that design was about a great deal more than form, the profession ceased to make a compelling case for design as a formal activity. It is not that the commitment to form went away—it just went unspoken, like beauty itself. We are surrounded by it, but can’t bring ourselves to say what it is.</p>


        <p>In design, we have overlooked the degree to which beauty is a vital human need. It is an experience from which people have everything to gain and nothing to lose. For the last year, I have been working on a book about Vaughan Oliver, the British designer. The music graphics he created in the 1980s, with Nigel Grierson, are dark, mysterious, strange—beautiful. I felt this at the time. I still feel it now. Other viewers seem to have felt the same way. There is nothing simple-minded about beauty. It’s a shock to the body as much as the head, a radical decentering, as Elaine Scarry puts it, which helps us to find our place in the world. It’s enormously hard to discuss, but we have to try. It makes no sense to talk about design and leave beauty out.</p>
