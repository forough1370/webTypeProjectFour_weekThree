        The reality is that graphic design is a profession wholly in thrall to its own visions of formal beauty. Beauty is the single quality designers most value and crave. In many ways, the debate about ugly design was a red herring. What was actually happening, at that point, was that new forms of expression and a new kind of beauty were emerging, and some people didn’t get it.

        <div class="main-text">
        So far I’ve been re-examining global pop, schmaltz, big-voiced singing and other aspects of Céline’s career from unaccustomed angles, finding thirteen ways of looking at a songbird, circling to try to find a more objective standpoint. But is there any objectivity to be found in artistic taste? The debate over whether beauty lies solely in the eye of the beholder runs through cultural history. It arises every time a critic makes a top ten list: Am I just naming the movies or books or albums I liked most in the preceding year, or am I asserting these ten works somehow were in fact the best or most significant? Do I dare to say the two claims are related? 

        <p>Less trivially, “objectivity” is in play whenever there is a court case of censorship that results in art experts being summoned to testify to the “merit” of the transgressing work. These opinions are treated as evidence, as if they came from a forensic report—except that the prosecutors also bring out their own professors, curators or critics to argue that the accused creation is in fact devoid of redeeming aesthetic or social value. The verdict often turns on which experts have more prestige, making their tastes more believable: If one set comes from small Christian schools and the other from Harvard and Oxford, you can guess the outcome. A string of such spectacles took place in the late 80s and early 90s when neoconservatives took aim at record companies for putting out heavy metal and rap albums that offended “family values” and at the National Endowment for the Arts for granting public funding to “obscene” art. These “culture wars” preoccupied arts advocates for nearly a decade. They could as easily have been called taste wars. </p>

        <p>One of the most trenchant responses came from a duo of immigrant artists, Russian expatriates Vitaly Komar and Alexandir Melamid: If the problem is what standards of taste ought to prevail in a diverse and democratic society, they asked, why not decide by democracy’s best approximation of “objectivity,” a popular vote? Since a taste election is difficult to imagine, Komar and Melamid (previously known for their satires on official Soviet socialist-realist art) settled for other thermometers of the public temperature: opinion polls and focus groups. They commissioned an $80,000 “People’s Choice” poll asking Americans what they liked and didn’t like in art—sizes, styles, subjects, colors—and proceeded to make two paintings: “America’s Most Wanted” and “America’s Most Unwanted.” </p>

        <p>The poll spoke loud and clear: America liked the color blue, and images of natural landscapes, historical figures, women and children and/or large mammals on midsized canvases. So Komar and Melamid produced a “dishwashersized” picture of rolling hills, blue skies and blue water beside which a family is picnicking while George Washington, a deer and a hippopotamus stand idly by. The “Most Unwanted” painting is a small, sharp-angled geometric abstract in gold and orange. They conducted smaller polls around the world: every country wanted a blue landscape. </p>

        <p>The laughs here aren’t just at the expense of popular taste. As Melamid said in an interview in the book Painting by Numbers: Komar and Melamid’s Scientific Guide to Art (1997): 

        <blockquote>There’s a crisis of ideas in art, which is felt by many, many people…. Artists now—I cannot speak for all, but I have talked to many artists who feel this way—we have lost even our belief that we are the minority that knows. We believed ten years ago, twenty years ago, that we knew the secret. Now we have lost this belief. We are a minority with no power and no belief, no faith. I feel myself, as an artist and as a citizen, just totally obsolete…. Okay, it can be done this way or that way or this way, or in splashes or smoothly, but why? What the hell is it about? That’s why we wanted to ask people. For us—from our point of view—it’s a sincere thing to understand something, to change the course. Because the way we live we cannot live anymore. I have never seen artists so desperate as they are now, in this society.</blockquote>
        Added Komar, in his accented English: </p>

        <p>Also, art world is not democratic society, but totalitarian decision-makers. This conflation of executive, legislative and judiciary is hallmark of totalitarian society. </p>

        <p>In collaboration with New York composer and neuroscientist Dave Soldier, they also conducted a smaller-scale, Internet survey to produce the People’s Choice Music. The uproarious “Most Unwanted Song” turned out to be, as dictated by the poll, more than twenty-five minutes long, included accordions, bagpipes, a children’s choir, banjo, flute, tuba and synthesizer (the only instrument in both the most wanted and most unwanted tunes) and mashed up opera, rap, Muzak, atonal music, advertising jingles and holiday songs. The “Most Wanted Song,” the song that would be “unavoidably and uncontrollably ‘liked’ by seventy-two percent, plus or minus twelve percent, of listeners,” was a five-minute R&B slow jam, a male–female duet with guitar, sax, drums, synths and strings. Critics often described it as sounding like…Céline Dion. And they all claimed to like the “Most Unwanted” much better. </p>

        <p>Is Céline Dion’s music a dishwasher-sized blue landscape? And if a statistically solid majority of the Earth’s people, plus or minus twelve percent, wanted to fill the world with sappy love songs, what would be wrong with that? Who gets to say? Komar and Melamid were addressing a widespread collapse of faith in all regimes of taste that previously guided not only the reception but the making of art. As refugees from a totalitarian state, they were earnest about democracy; as artists, they understood (as their project inevitably demonstrates) that the mechanisms of democracy are hopeless for art. No individual person would actually want the “Most Wanted Painting,” a ridiculous jumble of incongruent elements. It was a sincerely painful joke about art and democracy—as is the history of taste, for anyone who takes both democracy and art seriously. </p>

        <p>Komar and Melamid’s pseudoscientific project is a reminder that science so far has little to say about taste. Evolutionary theorists propose the blue-landscape ideal may derive from an embedded longing for the primeval savannah, and that admiration for musical virtuosity has to do with its function as sexual-status display, like a bird’s bright plumage. Anthropology finds social music (for dancing, religious rites, parties, relating stories) in all human cultures; music for “pure” listening is an anomaly. And brain science has shown how musical pleasure is structured by expectation and familiarity, in a particular song (when will the pattern resolve, and how?), between songs (is this music like other music we know and like?) and between genres (do you know the rules of this kind of music?). Balancing repetition and novelty is crucial: some songs feel too complicated to enjoy (like the “Most Unwanted” song) and others too clichéd to hold interest (as critics found the “Most Wanted”). There’s little explanation, though, of why people gravitate toward different ratios of surprise to familiarity. Going by the patrons of experimental music concerts, people who like formally unpredictable art are not especially prone to drive fast cars, bungee jump or even talk to strangers. But they do seem more likely also to be reading obscure novels or looking at weird paintings. Is there a “risk gene” for artistic adventurousness? </p>

        <p>The new discipline of musical neurobiology, well outlined in Montreal researcher (and ex-record producer) Daniel Levitin’s This Is Your Brain on Music (2006), hints that the brain might be built to prefer consonance to dissonance, steady rhythms over chaotic ones and so forth. However, these penchants seem to be malleable, as science journalist Jonah Lehrer says in Proust Was a Neuroscientist (2007). There’s a network of neurons in the brain stem specifically geared to sort unfamiliar sounds into patterns. When they succeed, the brain releases a dose of pleasure giving dopamine; when they fail, when a sound is too new, excess dopamine squirts out, disorienting and upsetting us. Lehrer suggests this explains events such as the 1913 riots at the Paris premiere of Igor Stravinsky’s dissonant The Rite of Spring. But these neurons also learn. With repeated exposure, they can tame the unknown, turn “noise” back into “music.” Thus, a year later, another Parisian audience cheered for The Rite of Spring and in 1940, Walt Disney put it in a children’s cartoon, Fantasia (appropriately enough, the dinosaurs-and-evolution sequence). </p>

        <p>The problem with this parable is that it isn’t really about repeated exposure. Maybe the brains of children in Fantasia’s audience were readied by having heard music influenced by Stravinsky. But what about the 1914 audience? It seems implausible it was mainly the rioters returning to give him a second chance. No, it would have been the hipsters of 1914, lured by the succèss de scandale and eager to be shocked, to take the dopamine overdose. Their neurons were prepared without ever hearing the sounds. The picture is fuzzy unless we can measure the effect of received concepts and social identifications on “private” neuro-auditory processes. </p>


        <p>Still, the field is young. I wouldn’t be surprised if variances in individual brain chemistry help explain taste predilections: if Céline fans and I disagree on whether her music is fresh, maybe my brain is a bigger dopamine junkie. Likewise, that the ranks of outré-music aficionados are so full of the socially awkward suggests their nonconformism may not be entirely by choice. (Artistic, autistic—watch your pronunciation.)</p>

        <p>But the bias that “conformity” is a pejorative has led, I think, to underestimating the part mimesis—imitation—plays in taste. It’s always other people following crowds, whereas my own taste reflects my specialness. A striking demonstration of the mimetic effect comes from a group of Columbia University sociologists, who took advantage of the Internet as a zone in which you can conduct large-scale simulations of mass-culture behavior, isolated from advertising and other distorting factors. They set up a website (as researcher Duncan J. Watts explains in a 2007 New York Times Magazine article) called Music Lab, where 14,000 registered participants were asked to “listen to, rate and, if they chose, download songs by bands they had never heard of.” One group could see only song titles and band names; the rest were divided into eight “worlds,” and could see which songs in their “world” were most downloaded. In these “social-influence worlds,” as soon as a song generated a few downloads, more people began downloading it. Higher-rated songs did do somewhat better, but each world had different “hits,” depending which songs “caught on” there first. They called the effect “cumulative advantage,” a rule that popularity tends to amplify exponentially. (In the control group, quality ratings and popularity usually matched). Does this mean people are lemmings? No, just that we’re social: we are curious what everybody else is hearing, want to belong, want to have things in common to talk about. We are also insecure about our own judgments and want to check them against others. So songs might in part be famous simply for being famous. Intriguingly, as Watts notes, “Introducing social influence into human decision making…didn’t just make the hits bigger; it also made them more unpredictable.”</p>

        <p>Perhaps cumulative advantage’s semirandomized conformity helps explain why the history of art is not all blue landscapes. When “early adopters” help make a Picasso famous, his reputation becomes self-inflating; the mutation becomes the mainstream, even though few people immediately like his paintings. Taste’s insecurity turns out to be the prerequisite for artistic growth. </p>

        <p>Aesthetics is the discipline created to contend with this insecurity, but considering that philosophy of art has been underway for at least three centuries (since the Enlightenment, and much longer if you include Aristotle), it comes up quite short on accounting for taste. It has analyzed elegantly the myriad ways the elements of art function, but when it confronts conflicts of taste, it engages in more retroactive rationalization than convincing illumination—and its verdicts on “good taste” often conveniently align with the taste the writer happens to hold.</p>

        <p>In one landmark essay, “Of the Standard of Taste” (1757), David Hume describes the tasteful person in terms that seem intuitively right: “Strong sense, united to delicate sentiment, improved by practice, perfected by comparison and cleared of all prejudice, can alone entitle critics to this valuable character; and the joint verdict of such, wherever they are to be found, is the true standard of taste and beauty.” But that’s a job description for critics, not a standard of taste. For that, Hume can only appeal to authority: the tasteful person will give approbation to works that stand the test of time—the works still approved by tasteful people later. It’s a tautological, survival-of-the-fittest view that’s no help in resolving quarrels of taste in our own lifetimes. His stipulation that the critic be credentialed with wide knowledge and experience could itself be described as a prejudice—a bias in favor of tradition, which may punish deviation from the “highest” standards and obstruct the creation of new ones. Exactly this kind of prejudice kept most high-culture Brahmins from accepting pop music or film as art at all until the 1960s. Hume acknowledges the need for artistic change, but he underestimates how determinedly his elite of taste aristocrats would resist it: the demand to be at once expert and unbiased is enough of a paradox that you could say Hume’s ideal critic by definition cannot exist.</p>

        <p>Aesthetic philosophy’s other great-granddaddy is Immanuel Kant. His Third Critique, The Critique of Judgment (1790), like Hume’s essay, begins from the dilemma that people can disagree on what is beautiful. But the parts of the Third Critique that dazzle are its limnings of the nature of beauty and of the sublime, and its subtly kinetic account of how reason, imagination and perception interact in “free play” to produce aesthetic judgment: Kant seems almost to intuit, two centuries in advance, how disparate chambers of the brain light up simultaneously when we listen to music, as recounted in Levitin’s book. When he tries to account for how these processes produce opposing judgments, however, Kant falls back on a fantasy that there’s a sensus communis, a “common sense” of beauty that would generate a consensus if only there were “ideal” conditions—including ample education, leisure, etcetera. Aesthetic agreement only eludes us because circumstances distort some people’s perceptions. A modern reader can’t help noticing that Kant’s ideal conditions suspiciously resemble being an educated eighteenth-century gentleman in cultured Koenigsburg. This “common sense” is not only unconvincing from a contemporary, diversity-oriented viewpoint—it doesn’t even sound desirable.</p> 

        <p>But some of his insights still seem crucial. Kant was the first to say that aesthetic judgments are by nature unprovable—they can’t be reduced to logic. Nevertheless, he pointed out, they always feel necessary and universal: when we think something’s great, we want everyone else to think it’s great too.</p>

        <p>Not long after Kant and Hume, whose contributions were only the weightiest in a more widespread dispute, the veracity of taste was largely put on the philosophical shelf. The “man of taste” tended to become a caricature—a figure out of Molière or Oscar Wilde, the dandy who lavishes more care on niceties of form and style than on deeper values. (In fact the clinching portrait of such a character was drawn even in the thick of the Enlightenment, in Denis Diderot’s extraordinary Rameau’s Nephew.) Many writers (Nietzsche among them) have lambasted Kant, in particular, for saying the appreciator of beauty must be “disinterested,” adopting a personal distance from the origins, content and implications—the meaning, if you will—of the work of art.</p>

        <p>The great American art critic Clement Greenberg, one of the rare later thinkers to take up the question, suggested that Romantic ideology raised art to such a sacred status in the nineteenth century that it seemed gauche to call attention to the process of evaluating it. Following Kant, Greenberg offered brilliant descriptions of the mental “switch” that is flipped when we regard something aesthetically—as we can do with anything, he argued, not just art, by contemplating an object or scene or person as “an end in itself,” apart from any other role or use—echoing Kant’s definition of beauty as “purposiveness without purpose.” Greenberg was also lucid on Kant’s insinuation that to enjoy art is also to judge it—you like it because it gives pleasure, but it can’t give you pleasure if you don’t like it.</p> 

        <p>Greenberg’s answer to taste conflict, however, was the same as Hume’s: we know there is objective taste because, over time, a consensus is reached on the great works of the past. (Never mind that anything ruled out by previous generations’ consensus is probably lost and unlikely to come messing with the current consensus.) The most objective taste in the present, he said, belongs to those who know that canon deeply but are also open to novelty. Which (surprise, surprise) sounds a lot like Clement Greenberg, although his openness seemed to ebb by the mid-1960s, when he began trashing new art movements as a decline from the modernism on which he’d made his critical reputation—a vivid case of the contradiction between mandarinism and flexibility. And that’s not even to mention his dismissal of mass culture as, first, “kitsch” and, later, “middlebrow”—either way, the enemy of “genuine” culture.</p>

        <p>Rather than by science or philosophy, the story of how aesthetic judgment reached the crisis felt by Komar and Melamid is best understood as a product of western art itself. To oversimplify wantonly, the disenchantment begins with the severing of visual art and music in particular from their religious role, in which the Church (and, rhetorically, God) is the ultimate art critic. After the Enlightenment, art gradually moves from an aristocratic status to a bourgeois one. The Romantics, in reaction, celebrate artistic genius as an autonomous agent of revelation, proudly outside society. Modernism gives that outsider status a harder edge: Art’s mission becomes not just to reveal higher truth but also to attack social falsehood. The very idea of “beauty” becomes a second-rate capitulation to bourgeois values—now ugliness, obscenity, formlessness and randomness all can be in the best of taste. Innovation becomes the yardstick, as artists continually attempt to outpace taste, to violate its terms or render it irrelevant. The belief is that to bring about a higher consciousness, it’s necessary not just to delight with newness but also to mount a shock attack on the old, bourgeois, decadent consciousness. As critic Boris Groys puts it, “Now it is not the observer who judges the artwork, but the artwork that judges—and often condemns—its public.” The motivations are varied—for some, it’s a psychoanalysis-inspired faith in the irrational; for others, it is revolutionary politics or plain misanthropy; for most, it’s just what bohemians do. And improbably, they succeed. Not that taste comes to an end, but the expectation of consensus withers.</p>

        <p>This is possible because attacks on conventional taste have been mounted from several directions. It’s an outcome of the disillusioning course of the twentieth century, as sounded in Theodor Adorno’s question of how to write poetry after Auschwitz. But mainly it’s a more upbeat, good-humored attack from the paradoxical partnership of capitalism—which seeks to remove any barriers to reaching all possible marketplaces—and democracy, which fosters the view that elite opinion is no better than anyone else’s. (Today they’ve been supplemented by their advanced outgrowths, globalization and identity politics.) The most powerful vehicle for that alliance is mass culture. Pop songs and movies and genre fiction and magazines are so appealing, achieve so much aesthetically for so many people, that snobbery cannot hold the line against them. With Pop Art, camp aesthetics and rock ‘n’ roll, the notions of highbrow, middlebrow and lowbrow—which from nearly the dawn of mass culture dominated discussions of taste (see historian Michael Kammen’s American Culture, American Tastes)—start to fall apart. By the early twenty-first century, almost no one believes in them.</p>

        <p>Among artists themselves, the continual process of violating limits seems to reach an endpoint or at least exhaustion, and anything-goes eclecticism takes its place (critic and philosopher Arthur Danto calls this “the end of art history” or “post-art”). Among audiences, a growing fragmentation and subculturization accomplishes similar ends: though indie-rock and classical listeners, science-fiction fans and architecture buffs, rockabillies and swing kids, hip-hop heads and salsa dancers may believe strongly in their own tastes, in aggregate they are acclimatized to the notion that separate “taste worlds” can coexist peacefully, without need for external, official inspection and verification.</p>

        <p>Early on, this shift brought pop-culture criticism into its own. While there had been a few serious commentators on movies and jazz, the treatment of pop and mass culture in North America was mainly confined to light journalism until the advent of writers such as Pauline Kael and Andrew Sarris on film (as well as their equivalents in France) and the “counterculture” press that created rock criticism, with writers such as Robert Christgau, Greil Marcus, Lester Bangs and Ellen Willis. While film critics usually made the case that film deserved appreciation on a par with high art, rock criticism began with a more radical stance against elite taste, arguing no work was too humble for aesthetic contemplation—that a form’s most “low” or “impure” qualities could be its strengths. As the field grew, that attitude was watered down: some writers reintroduced traditional hierarchies in updated forms; a rough idea of a pop/rock canon began to coalesce in books like the Rolling Stone Record Guides; other fans and critics, especially after punk, adopted a harsh line on “selling out” to an entertainment industry that, like Greenberg or Adorno before them, they considered a capitalist scheme to foist brainless product on a beclouded public; and so on. The debates over “rockism” and “popism” are symptoms of present unease about standards and subjectivism, as is, of course, this book. But the mandate to dethrone taste orthodoxies remains part of pop criticism’s legacy, so much so that it may help bring its own extinction: Within what more than one writer has called “No-Brow” culture, who needs professional critics? What do they offer, if not objectivity?</p> 

        <p>The one bothersome matter in this anarchic taste universe (a utopia or dystopia, depending on your ideology, but one that cannot be wished away) is the persistence of a mainstream—what Greenberg or his contemporary Dwight Macdonald would have called “middlebrow” culture, the politely domineering realm where Céline Dion is queen, unattached to any validating subculture. Middlebrow is the new lowbrow—mainstream taste the only taste for which you still have to say you’re sorry. And there, taste seems less an aesthetic question than, again, a social one: among the thousands of varieties of aesthetes and geeks and hobbyists, each with their special-ordered cultural diet, the abiding mystery of mainstream culture is, “Who the hell are those people?” Perhaps Komar and Melamid are right: the way to the heart of taste today may be through a poll.</p>

        <p><h3>*Let’s Talk About Who’s Got Bad Taste*</h3> The poll I have in mind was conducted in the mid-1960s in France by a team of researchers under sociologist Pierre Bourdieu. It surveyed thousands of people on what kinds of culture they knew, liked and participated in—not just in the arts, but sports, hobbies, foods, styles of dress and furniture, the newspapers and TV programs they followed, etcetera. All this data was correlated with information about their incomes, education levels, family backgrounds and occupations, and supplemented with interviews in which people were asked to discuss and defend their preferences.</p>

        <p>The result was a milestone of social science, Bourdieu’s 1979 tome Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste. Note the subtitle, a flip of the bird to Kant’s Enlightenment notion of disinterested aesthetic judgment: For Bourdieu, taste is always interested—in fact, self-interested—and those interests are social. His theories press the point that aesthetics are social all the way down, just a set of euphemisms for a starker system of inequality and competition: if you flinch at seeing a copy of Let’s Talk About Love or The da Vinci Code on a friend’s shelves, what you are trying to shake off is the stain of the déclassé, the threat of social inferiority. </p>

        <p>What made him think so? His survey data had confirmed stereotypes to a staggering degree: almost exclusively, French people with working-class jobs knew and liked only relatively “lowbrow” culture; the middle classes liked “middlebrow” stuff; and the better-off were patrons of “highbrow” culture. Aesthetic and lifestyle choices even clustered along more minute divisions within classes: workers in factories had different tastes than workers in shopping centers; office managers differed from small-business owners; surgeons’ tastes were unlike those of corporate executives. </p>

        <p>But it was in asking people the reasons behind their choices that Bourdieu exploded the assumptions embedded in the whole “brow” system (which originated in racist nineteenth-century theories about facial features and intelligence). What he found was that poorer people were pragmatic about their tastes, describing them as entertaining, useful and accessible. But from the middle classes up, people had much grander justifications. For one thing, they were far more confident about their dislikes, about what was tacky or lame. But they also spoke in elaborate detail about how their tastes reflected their values and personalities, and in what areas they still wanted to enrich their knowledge.</p> 

        <p>Bourdieu’s interpretation was that tastes were serving as strategic tools. While working-class tastes seemed mainly a default (serving at best to express group belongingness and solidarity), for everyone else taste was not only a product of economic and educational background but, as it developed through life, a force mobilized as part of their quest for social status (or what Bourdieu called symbolic power). What we have agreed to call tastes, he said, is an array of symbolic associations we use to set ourselves apart from those whose social ranking is beneath us, and to take aim at the status we think we deserve. Taste is a means of distinguishing ourselves from others, the pursuit of distinction. And its end product is to perpetuate and reproduce the class structure.</p> 

        <p>His argument may seem less counterintuitive if you put it in terms of evolutionary psychology: if human beings are driven to advance in status in order to acquire mates and provide security to their offspring, Bourdieu was proposing that taste is a tool of those instincts, used to gain competitive advantage; and in a capitalist society, class is how this competition is structured (and exacerbated), to the advantage of the dominant elite.</p> 

        <p>Was he saying that when you become a bank manager, you automatically start liking the music other bank managers like? No, nothing so mechanical. Unlike previous, reductive Marxist theorists of culture, Bourdieu wanted to account for the fact that we experience tastes as both spontaneous attractions and personal choices. To square individuality and agency with the consistency of his data, he needed new conceptual terms. He made an analogy with economics: Imagine that capital comes in forms other than money and property, such as cultural capital (knowledge and experience of culture, ideas and references) and social capital (personal connections and influence), terms he coined that have come into common usage. As with money, cultural and social capital’s value depends on scarcity, on one knowing what others don’t. Sometimes forms of capital are interchangeable: I can buy cultural knowledge through education, which may lead to a better job and connections. Often they are not: a university professor may have top-flight cultural and social capital, but she cannot command a CEO’s salary. For Bourdieu, class is determined not just by income or occupation but by how much of all these forms of capital you have, and in what combinations.</p> 

        <p>The class segment you’re born, raised and schooled in produces what Bourdieu called your habitus, meaning both your home base and your habits: the attitudes, abilities and expectations your upbringing has nurtured. You then make choices, consciously or unconsciously, to maximize your satisfaction in life within the bounds your habitus makes thinkable: it does not dictate what you do, but it serves as a filter for your predilections and decisions. It’s like a jazz musician improvising on a standard: You can alter the notes and rhythms of the melody, but your improvisation is limited by the tempo and chord changes available in the song. To choose otherwise would be to play “badly” and discordantly and risk failure and ostracization. (On the Bourdieuvian bandstand, there is no free jazz.)</p>

        <p>Along with habitus, the other major social structures for Bourdieu are fields—social institutions or networks through which we pursue our goals, such as the political, cultural, corporate, academic, legal, medical or religious fields (each including subfields with their own rules and pecking orders). The pursuit of distinction takes place in those fields. Tastes are the result of the interaction of habitus and field—attempts, informed by our backgrounds, to advance our status by accumulating cultural and social capital in particular spheres—and, perhaps more importantly, to prevent ourselves from ever being mistaken for someone of a lower status. Bourdieu wrote that “tastes are perhaps first and foremost distastes, disgusts provoked by horror or visceral intolerance of the tastes of others.”</p> 

        <p>His point is not that people are only pretending to like or dislike the culture they like and dislike, trying to con people into thinking highly of them. The pleasure of listening to music or playing a sport is obviously real. The argument is that the kinds of music and sports we choose, and how we talk about them, are socially shaped—that the cultural filters and concepts that guide my interests in and reactions to music, clothes, films or home decoration come out of my class and field. At worst I am conning myself, but to what I feel is my advantage.</p> 

        <p>It’s not so strange an idea that there are social subtexts to our tastes: You might be a Julliard music student with a trust fund who associates authenticity with the inner city or the backwoods, and feel a little realer yourself when you kick it to Snoop or clean the condo with some bluegrass on. You may be less enamored of what you imagine about frat boys or soccer moms, and avoid music that conjures up such listeners. Or if you are a soccer mom, you may want to be the soccer mom who listens to Slayer, because you want to stay a little young and wild, not like those soccer moms who listen to Sheryl Crow.</p> 

        <p>In early twenty-first-century terms, for most people under fifty, distinction boils down to cool. Cool confers status—symbolic power. It incorporates both cultural capital and social capital, and it’s a clear potential route to economic capital. Corporations and culture-makers pursue it as much as individuals do. It changes attributes in different milieus. As much as we avow otherwise, few of us are truly indifferent to cool, not a little anxious about whether we have enough, and Bourdieu’s theory may illustrate why that’s not merely shallow: Being uncool has material consequences. Sexual opportunity, career advancement and respect, even elementary security can ride on it. To ignore cool may mean risking downward mobility at a time when many people are falling out of the middle class.</p>

        <p>Even being deliberately uncool doesn’t save you, as that’s an attempt to flip the rules in your favor. Having a “guilty pleasure,” for instance, can be an asset in this system of cultural capital because it suggests that you are so cool that you can afford to risk it on something goofy, ungainly and awkward—which makes you that much cooler. A few people with real panache, like an Andy Warhol or John Waters, can assemble taste profiles that consist of nothing but guilty pleasures and be ultra-cool, but that takes at least social capital, so that the kitsch connoisseur can be distinguished from the doofus who just likes goofball stuff. (For you to be cool requires someone else to be less cool.)</p> 

        <p>The clearest way to understand distinction may be in high-school terms: Say you’re a white, nerdy fifteen-year-old boy who listens to High School Musical (if you’re too old to know what High School Musical is, substitute the Andrew Lloyd Webber of your choice) but you come to see you have a chance at becoming friends with the tough kids who smoke behind the school. So you start listening to death metal and wearing hacked-up jean jackets. This isn’t a ruse: you just start to see what’s plausible and exciting for you about those tastes. Here, death metal is cultural capital, high-school cliques are the field and your habitus is what’s likely to determine whether you can carry off the slang and the haircut. Your instinct is to distinguish yourself from the nerds by becoming one of the tough kids, who, incidentally, hate High School Musical (or Cats) with a vengeance, because that’s what nerds listen to. That’s distinction.</p> 

        <p>The indie-rock cliché of “I used to like that band”—i.e. until people like you liked them—is a sterling example of distinction in action. In fact, distinction helps explain the rapidity of artistic change (artists are competing for distinction) as well as some of the resistance: changing styles threaten to bankrupt some people’s cultural capital, to lower the status of those who associated themselves with the older style. Bourdieu argues innovation will usually come from individuals in a field who do not yet have secure positions, attempting to change the game to their own advantage, while established artists, curators, critics, producers, etcetera, try for as long as they can to preserve the rules by which they were winning.</p>

        <p>Distinction might also demystify Kant’s claim that taste always desires others’ agreement. Your love of hip-hop or hatred for Céline Dion (or vice-versa) is part of your cultural capital, but it only gains value in the competition for distinction if it is legitimated in the contexts that matter to you. Unlike Kant, though, Bourdieu would say the last thing you want is that agreement be universal: you want your taste affirmed by your peers and those you admire, but it’s just as vital that your redneck uncle thinks you’re an idiot to like that rap shit. It proves you’ve distinguished yourself from him successfully, and can bask in righteous satisfaction.</p>

        <p>To the extent we agree that coolness and lack of same are enormously influential—and that coolness is a social category, not a natural attribute (with the possible exception of Keith Richards)—we are all Bourdieuvians.</p> 

        <p>One of Bourdieu’s most striking notions is that there’s also an inherent antagonism between people in fields structured mainly by cultural capital and those in fields where there is primarily economic capital: while high-ranking artists and intellectuals are part of the dominant class in society thanks to their education and influence, they are a dominated segment of that class compared to actual rich people. This helps explain why so many artists, journalists and academics can see themselves as anti-establishment subversives while most of the public sees them as smug elitists. And this opposition between cultural and economic capital carries down into less-privileged class strata, perhaps helping to motivate school teachers to vote for Democrats (currently the party associated with cultural capital) and auto workers to vote Republican (symbolically the party of economic capital).</p> 

        <p>Artistic taste is most competitive among people whose main asset is cultural capital. That’s why high school serves as such a vivid backdrop for illustrations of how distinction in artistic taste works: Not only is high school a field we all know, it’s one in which there’s practically nothing but cultural and social capital; money plays more of a backstage role. In adult life, it’s only in culture-centered fields (the arts, academia) that musical or other artistic taste matters the way it does in high school. However, recall that Bourdieu defines taste very broadly, to include tastes in clothes, food, leisure activities, architecture and interior decoration, sports, news sources, etcetera, and you can see how much taste continues to count for the social position of adults in business and political life.</p> 

        <p>The theory of distinction is reminiscent of Thorstein Veblen’s famous critique of conspicuous consumption, but it is less liable to self-congratulatory misreading. It’s not that some people are in the grip of a craven obsession with keeping up with the Joneses while less materialistic sorts can stand aloof. Inconspicuous consumption can be distinction-oriented too: It distinguishes us from those tacky, materialist people. No one is exempt.</p> 

        <p>And neither is any artistic field. Bourdieu’s tools also offer a revision of the mid-century Frankfurt School critique of the Culture Industry, in which Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer (having witnessed the Nazi use of mass communications for propaganda) talked about popular culture as if it were a quasi-fascist conspiracy to dull and numb the masses. What if, instead, the mass-cultural field is just another zone of competition for distinction, no more or less venal than others? Bourdieu (who died in 2002 at age seventy-one) disliked mass culture himself, but his theories imply that high culture is at least as culpable for social inequity as popular culture is, riddled with gambits to raise its own status and derogate its inferiors. By Bourdieu’s lights, if there’s such a thing as false consciousness, then everybody has it, at least until they become self-conscious of the social nature of their tastes. It’s a useful corrective to the biases of fans and critics who think alternative or independent music is somehow inherently less status-seeking, more real, than pop music. (Which is simply a less-coherent repeat of Adorno’s anticommercial attack on jazz.)</p> 

        <p>The translation of distinction to cool leads us to one of the problems with applying Bourdieu’s model nearly forty years after his research: his original survey did not reflect the relatively recent shakeup in taste categories, the seeming collapse of high and low culture into a No-Brow society in which an in-depth knowledge of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Japanese ganguro fashions and the latest graffiti artists may carry more cachet than a conversance with Molière, Schoenberg and Donald Judd. Does that mean his theory is outmoded?</p> 

        <p>No. For Bourdieu, it doesn’t matter what the objects of good taste are at any moment. Change the value of x and the equation stays the same. He notes that a once-refined or highbrow piece of music, such as the Moonlight Sonata, can be reassigned to middlebrow culture when it has become overly familiar. Its relative uncoolness is an attribute not of the composition, but of its commonplaceness. Cool things gradually become uncool.</p> 

        <p>Still, in a hyper-mediated, mass-production culture, a lot of reference points are shared across classes. Almost everyone now will wear jeans. Nearly everybody has spent time listening to rock music. So there is more mixing and matching than Bourdieu’s theories would seem to permit. American sociologists Richard Petersen and Roger Kern in the mid-1990s suggested that the upper-class taste model had changed from a “snob” to an “omnivore” ideal, in which the coolest thing for a well-off and well-educated person to do is to consume some high culture along with heaps of popular culture, international art and lowbrow entertainment: a contemporary opera one evening, the roller derby and an Afrobeat show the next. They speculate that the shift corresponds to a new elite requirement to be able to “code switch” in varied cultural settings, due to multiculturalism and globalization. (Bourdieu’s own son Emmanuel, now a film director in his forties, is a perfect omnivore, according to a recent profile in the New York Times: “He’s capable of speaking equally seriously about Leibniz’s philosophy and about Antonio Banderas’s Legend of Zorro.”) Petersen and Kern thought it likely that the less privileged would, correspondingly, have narrower patterns of cultural consumption; other researchers think there might be distinct upper-, middle- and lower-class omnivore styles.</p> 

        <p>But nobody is a true omnivore. To have taste at all means to exclude. It’s one thing to prove that well-off people now listen to classical and rock and hip-hop, read literary novels and watch sitcoms, but to show there aren’t subtler hierarchies of preference would require dauntingly in-depth research. Most available studies suffer from an inbuilt bias: academics, as the studies themselves show, are nearly the only group in contemporary society that still pays most of its attention to high culture. So when they design their surveys, they ask people to choose between Bach, Philip Glass and hip-hop, not between, say, pop-chart hip-hop, cocaine-rap mixtapes and politicized underground rap, even though each one carries status and identity implications. Distinctions in a culture that valorizes omnivorism are simply that much more fine-grained, fast-changing and invidious.</p> 

        <p>Even without more meticulous divisions, though, you can still detect class bias in omnivore tastes: In a paper titled “‘Anything But Heavy Metal’: Symbolic Exclusion and Musical Dislikes,” Princeton sociologist Bethany Bryson compiled data on musical tastes and political attitudes, by education level, from the 1993 General Social Survey (conducted annually by a research center at the University of Chicago). Sure enough, she found that the most educated, high-cultural-capital respondents (who were also the most politically liberal and racially tolerant) disliked the fewest forms of music. In particular, highly educated white people were much less likely to reject Latin, jazz, blues and R&B than other white respondents; Bryson described them as maximizing their “multicultural capital.” But they did have music they disliked—the four types that had the least-educated fans: rap, heavy metal, country and gospel. Since in 1993 anti-rap feelings cut across all groups, in fact the white omnivores were distinguishing themselves quite specifically from “white trash.” (Is this perhaps a reason Céline is more swiftly and rudely ejected from music discussions than her black-diva counterparts?)</p> 

        <p>s well, even when they’re enjoying the same stuff, the classes still have different motivations. In a study in the Journal of Consumer Research in 1998, sociologist Douglas B. Holt found that there was plenty of high-and-low cultural mixology going on among the people he interviewed in a small Pennsylvania town, especially among higher-status subjects. But the “low cultural capital” interviewees talked about their cultural choices as practical, fun, community-oriented and easy to relate to. Meanwhile the “high cultural capital” subjects described their preferences as showing authenticity, uniqueness, quality, cosmopolitanism and personal creative expression. Overall, to quote the Starkist tuna ad, lower-class respondents said what they liked “tasted good,” while the higher-class ones said what they liked was “in good taste.” Just as in France in the mid-sixties, the privileged felt their tastes set them apart from the common horde and made them special.</p> 
        <br>At this point I should say that I don’t think Bourdieu was entirely right.</br> 

        <p>Recent studies indicate that while social status—income and education—does correlate significantly with tastes and distastes, it is not nearly as all-explanatory as it seemed in Bourdieu’s study. Other factors turn out to play a comparable role, such as ethnicity, gender and regional background. Other times tastes don’t fall into any sociologically measurable categories. Perhaps France in the 1960s was unusually rigid and orthodox in its class stratifications (although in North America, class-mobility data says the average person is much less likely to rise in status today compared to thirty years ago). More likely, his research was unconsciously designed to present the strongest case for what he already believed, as research so often is: you might say Bourdieu’s taste in survey questions operated to increase his own cultural capital. More generously, he was overcorrecting against the insular, ivory-tower view of taste and aesthetic “disinterestedness” that had come down from Kant through the cultural elite for two centuries, and shouting to make his point heard.</p> 

        <p>On top of that, his tendency to blame everything unpleasant about the way taste functions on modern capitalism was, well, very French. I suspect that the status-seeking reflex he was describing would re-emerge in any complex society: it can be ameliorated but not eliminated. Besides, we didn’t start loving beauty, enjoying songs, making pictures and discussing them solely for competitive advantage. While they may be shaped partly to that end, we also do them for their own sake, for all the benefits traditionally ascribed to artistic experience. But even if Bourdieu was only fifty percent right—if taste is only half a subconscious mechanism by which we fight for power and status, mainly by condemning people we consider “beneath” us—that would be twice as complicit in class discrimination as most of us would like to think our aesthetics are.</p> 


        <p>And his account does feel at least half-accurate as a description of what is happening when I react allergically to Céline Dion. I’m intuiting that there’s no sleight of hand or subtle reinterpretation I can use to fit her music into my store of cultural capital: it can only make me dorkier if I listen to it, so I push it away hard and fast. Conversely, her fans, from another class or field standpoint, find something in the music that seems to increase their own cultural capital, the value of her voice or her romanticism or her westernness, so they latch on.</p> 

        <p>Besides being a bright caution light against rushing to call musicians naff, tacky or kétaine, this thought is discouraging for our experiment: Even if I can set my prejudices and status anxieties aside in a more fundamental way than Hume ever imagined, and find aspects of Céline’s music to embrace, the research suggests that I’m not going to appreciate her in the same terms her fans do. The very act of writing this book suggests an effort to plug her back into my pre-existing, class-based sets of culture processors…perhaps by granting her a role in a social critique. Indeed you could fairly say that my experiment is an attempt to expand my cultural capital among music critics, to gain symbolic status by being the most omnivorous of all. My only answer is that any move I make as a critic is open to similar charges. What can you do? The game of distinction may reproduce class structure, but it also makes the world go ’round.</p>

        <p>Still, that all depends whether Céline fans and I really, as Bourdieu would predict, come from different walks of life, at least enough so that I would want to distinguish myself from their “bad taste.” That jerk in the Independent who said that Céline’s fan base must be in “some middle-of-the-road Middle England invisible to the rest of us” was indulging in a bit of speculative Bourdieuvian sociology, extrapolating from taste to characterize her devotees as “grannies, tux-wearers, overweight children, mobile-phone salesmen,” images straight out of the BBC’s class-hatred comedy series, Little Britain. I’d prefer something a bit more empirical, but I don’t have a team of researchers to phone up thousands of households. Luckily, Céline’s record company does.</p> 



        <p>The NPD Group, a market-research company in New York, assembled a demographic profile of American Céline Dion consumers for Sony from January of 2005 to December of 2006. It doesn’t tell us whether they are overweight or sell mobile phones but what it does say is suggestive. It compared Céline listeners to US music consumers as a whole: In age, for example, the Céline Dion buyer was seventy-five percent less likely than your average music buyer to be a teenager. Aside from a bump in the early twenties (perhaps because those people were teens when Titanic and Let’s Talk About Love came out), her audience skews to the over-thirty-five—in fact, around forty-five percent of Céline listeners were over fifty, compared to only twenty percent of music buyers overall. Add to that the fact that sixty-eight percent of her listeners were female: Grannies? Check. In fact, Céline fans were about three-and-a-half times more likely to be widowed than the average music listener. It’s hard to imagine an audience that could confer less cool on a musician.</p>


        <p>Céline fans were less likely than the average music buyer to be black, though thirteen percent of them were. Reflecting her global-star status, they were more likely than most music fans to be neither black nor white. They were less likely to live on the coasts than in the “red” or “fly-over” states, the US equivalent of “Middle England,” plus that haven for older ladies, Florida. They tended to buy their Céline albums from big-box discount stores, and often they discovered her on TV. They were much less likely than other consumers to be downloading songs on the Internet, legally or illegally.</p> 

        <p>But let’s get to the meatier socioeconomics: A disproportionate part of her audience was in the lowest income bracket, under $25,000 a year, and again in the next-lowest category. Her fans were relatively underrepresented in the high-income brackets (over $75,000 a year), but a quarter of them did claim to make at least that much. It was education that gave me a surprise: Céline fans were significantly less likely than the average music buyer to have only a high-school education or less. The shortage of teenagers helps explain that, but not entirely. More often, they had “some college,” meaning an incomplete degree (or perhaps a community-college certificate), but the number of college graduates was only slightly below average, and those with “post-college” schooling slightly above (which could mean grad school but could also mean continuing education).</p> 

        <p>It’s vague, but it does stimulate the imagination. Rather than the abject losers of the Independent’s fantasy, what I picture is a striving bunch (grannies included), many of them with training in what I would guess (combining the education and income stats) are the ill-paid “helping professions,” such as nursing, teaching, public relations, human resources and other middle-class service careers. Bourdieu painted these people (with far less sympathy than he had for manual workers and petty clerks) as the ultimate middlebrow sector, “the new petite bourgeois,” who he said demonstrated an excess of “cultural goodwill”: Having disconnected from their likely roots in working-class culture, they were gamely but not very suavely trying to adjust themselves to what they believed were “the higher things.” In his interviews he found that they held a fairly straitlaced set of moral values, tempered by a sentimental streak. Full of aspiration, but with prospects much lower than their dreams, they might fairly be guessed to overlap with readers of self-help of Céline’s schmaltz, there probably aren’t a lot of bloggers and tech heads. In the wealthier part of the listenership, you’d probably find much of the Vegas crowd—middle managers, lower-rung executives and their families (or their widows), with a sizable smattering of business immigrants and ESL students. The survey didn’t ask about sexual orientation, but with diva audiences, and Céline’s in particular, there’s little doubt gay men and lesbians are also represented, possibly skewing up the income and education curves.</p> 

        <p>Widows and grannies aside, what occurs to me is that this midlevel cultural-capital audience is not as far from the average white pop critic as we might have expected. We usually make middling incomes or worse, and while most have university degrees, our expertise is usually more self-taught than PhD-certified, a pattern Bourdieu believed would produce an anxious, fact-hoarding intellectual style in contrast with the relaxed mastery of a fully legitimated cultural elite. (If you’ve met any pop critics, you’ll see his point.) When a critic or heavily invested music buff says, as they often do, that discovering music or writing “saved my life,” I think what lurks behind the melodrama is a feeling that a facility with pop culture and words has saved us from the life of subservient career, suburban lifestyle and quiet desperation we imagine befalls people like Céline Dion’s white American fans, as well as fans of Billy Joel, Michael Bolton and the other midlevel musicians whose names so often serve us as epithets. Perhaps our scathing tongues are enacting what Freud called the narcissism of small differences, in defense of what Bourdieu might call a very fragile distinction. If middlebrow has been designated the new lowbrow, maybe this is why.</p>
